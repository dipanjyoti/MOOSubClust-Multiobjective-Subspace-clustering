# Multi-objective non-overlapping Subspace Clustering

Developed a multi-objective optimization based subspace clustering considering an evolutionary based framework.

# Motivation

Subspace clustering techniques become paramount in pattern recognition for detecting local variations from high dimensional data. Several techniques exist in the recent literature for subspace clustering, majority of which optimize implicitly or explicitly a single cluster quality measure. Inspired by the success of multi-objective optimization in solving clustering problem, we developed a multi-objective based subspace clustering technique in this paper.

The method is an meta-heuristic based evolutionary approach where two existing cluster quality measures, XB-index and PBM-index, are modified to develop subspace cluster validity indices, and then those are used as optimization criteria.
